# HomeValueRegression
I use a dataset of homes and examine how well variables other than neighborhood average home selling price (the best predictor of home prices) to see if my regression model can accurately predict home price without this information. The README file contains more information about the dataset and my R notebook.
The dataset is Boston house-price data from a journal:
Harrison, D. and Rubinfeld, D.L. 'Hedonic prices and the demand for clean air', J. Environ. Economics & Management, vol.5, 81-102, 1978.
This journal and dataset was originally meant to examine the association between air quality and home price, but I find it to contain a lot of other interesting housing market variables that I could use for my regression
The R file contains my initial exploratory analysis of this data and some potential regression models with different constructions. It also makes sure some statistical assumptions are satisfied for the regression.
